        <p>Hi!</p>
        <p>This site contains a collection of my notes for front end web development.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As I began my web developer journey I wrote detailed notes which I often looked back through. To make things a little more organized and easier to read I started writing my notes as markdown files. This helped greatly in terms of searching as I could use any text editor and its find tool.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Guessing that I'm not the only one who has wanted to learn web development. I decided to share my notes by turning them into a website. I made this site so that you can access my notes whenever you like and continue your web development journey.</p>
        <br>
        <p>If you find this site helpful or have any suggestions for improvement, let me know on <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/ruben_a_sanchez">Twitter</a>. I'd like to hear from you.</p>
